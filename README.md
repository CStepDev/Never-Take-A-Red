# Never Take A Red - Codebase
 The codebase for Never Take A Red; the 2018 game submission for my Combined Games Project 3 group. This repo is limited to the codebase due to it being the aspect of the project I primarily worked on, and assets such as models, sounds, textures, etc are beholden to various licenses which prevent them from being shared.
